Project Description

The walk_python project is a tool for automating keyboard key presses. It allows simulating key presses with specified delays and durations. It's useful for automated testing, gaming, or any processes requiring keyboard interaction.

How to Use
1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed:

Install the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Running the Script
